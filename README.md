kokakolako-theme
================

Introduction
----------------
This repository is my default wordpress theme. My aim is to create a nice theme that can use by everyone for free. This time I use the theme for example at my [blog "kokakolako"](http://kokakolako.de).

The current state of my theme is that I create a nice looking theme but have it not very good optimized for usability when you want to use my theme at your own wordpress blog.

Frameworks
----------------

The kokakolako-theme is build with the following tools:

* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)
* [Google Webfonts](http://www.google.com/webfonts)
* [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/)
* [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/)

TO-DO
----------------

In future I want to create a theme with the following attributes and features:

* user-oriented well formatted documentation
* open-source project status
* complete customizable (it should also be customizable from the wordpress backend)
* responsive (it is currency responsive but the theme must be better optimized for cell-phones in an resolution from < 350px)
* a feature presentation like the tiles from [the Verge](http://theverge.com)
* a better sidebar that use the complete height from the page (compared to the main content)

I guess that theire will appear in future a lot of more stuff and I would be happy when someone who get an idea for a new awesome feature would told me that.
