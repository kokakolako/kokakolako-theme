kokakolako-theme
================

Introduction
----------------
This repository is my default wordpress theme. My aim is to create a nice theme that can use by everyone for free. This time I use the theme for example at my blog ["kokakolako"](http://kokakolako.de).

The current state of my theme is that I created a nice looking theme but have it not very good optimized for usability when you want to use my theme at your own wordpress blog.

In future I want to create a theme with the following attributes and features:

* user-oriented well formatted documentation
* open-source project status
* complete customizable (it should also be customizable from the wordpress backend)
* responsive (it is currency responsive but the theme must be better optimized for cell-phones in an resolution from < 350px)
* a feature presentation like the tiles from [the Verge](http://theverge.com)
* a better sidebar that use the complete height from the page (compared to the main content)
* recyclable and easy to use at other wordpress sites

I guess that theire will appear in future a lot of more stuff and I would be happy when someone who get an idea for a new awesome feature would told me that.
